# Python for Data Science

  I am supposed to say something smart about using Python for Data Science over here.  Well, I do not have any but there are always opinions online. Check out this [Quora](http://www.quora.com/Why-is-Python-a-language-of-choice-for-data-scientists).

## Installation

### Installing Python

Most unix-based systems such as Ubuntu, Debian and OS X normally come install with Python. We will use Python 2.7 or above BUT NOT Python 3.0 and above. To check the version of Python on your system, type `python --version` into your terminal.

**The installation instructions below are geared toward Debian/Ubuntu OS. OS X will be added soon.**

### Essential Libraries

+ **Pip**

  Pip is a library for easy installation of Python libraries.

  Install: `sudo apt-get install python-pip`

###NB: The rest of the packages can be installed in one line with the code below:
  `sudo pip install numpy pandas matplotlib ipython scipy`

+ **Numpy**

  Numerical Python package for scientific computing in Python. Many scientific and analytical libraries are built on top of this.

  Install: `sudo pip install numpy`

+ **pandas**

  rich data structures and functions for working with structured data

  Install: `sudo pip install pandas`

+ **matplotlib**

  Python library for plot and 2D data visualisations

  Install: `sudo pip install matplotlib`

+ **IPython and IPython-Notebook**

  Python environment for interactive and exploratory computing. It accelerates writing, testing and debugging of Python code.

  Install: `sudo pip install ipython`

+ **SciPy**

  Collection of packages to tackle different standard problem domains in scientific computing.

  Install: `sudo pip install scipy`
